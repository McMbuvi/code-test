Java code solution to the water points data processing module problem.

This module processes water points data set in json format and including the provided data set at the url:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onaio/ona-tech/master/data/water_points.json. The output of the program
is a JSON object that contains the number of functional water points, the number of water points per community
and the ranking of each community depending on the number of broken water points.

The solution passes all the tests that have been written.
